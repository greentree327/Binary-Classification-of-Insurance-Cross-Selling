# XGBoost Model for Predictive Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model using the XGBoost library to analyze and predict the response variable. The dataset is imbalanced, with a significant majority class (`Response = 0`). The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, as well as various strategies to handle class imbalance, including downsampling and hyperparameter tuning.

## Data Import and Preprocessing

We start by importing the necessary data from CSV files. The dataset is then checked for missing values and the distribution of the target variable (`Response`) is analyzed to identify class imbalance.

## Feature Engineering

### Categorical Feature Encoding

Categorical features are encoded using techniques like label encoding and boolean masking.

### Box Plots and Bar Plots

Visualizations such as box plots and bar plots are used to explore the distribution of features across different classes.

## Data Splitting

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class distribution.

## Model Training and Evaluation

XGBoost is used to train the model. Various parameters like `max_bin` and `scale_pos_weight` are fine-tuned to handle the class imbalance and improve model performance. Downsampling is applied to create a balanced dataset for training.

## Feature Importance Analysis

Feature importance is analyzed using two metrics:
- **Gain**: Measures the contribution of each feature to the AUC-ROC score.
- **Weight**: Counts the number of times a feature is used to split the data.

## Feature Engineering for Predictive Power

Two approaches are used:
1. Combining the most predictive features with other features.
2. Using the correlation matrix to combine less correlated features for better predictive power.

## Fine-Tuning XGBoost Model

Hyperparameters such as `scale_pos_weight` and `max_depth` are optimized using tools like Optuna.

## Cross-Validation and Bagging

A cross-validation approach with bagging is implemented to ensure robust model performance. The model is evaluated using metrics like ROC-AUC score.

## Submission File Generation

The final predictions are saved to a CSV file for submission.

## Insights

- Use different `random_state` values in downsampling and bagging steps to ensure diverse sample selection from the majority class.
- Feature engineering can significantly impact the model's predictive power, especially in imbalanced datasets.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Data Import**: Place the CSV files in the project directory and run the `final_submission.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data and engineer features.
3. **Model Training**: Train the model using the provided XGBoost parameters.
4. **Evaluation and Submission**: Evaluate the model and generate submission files.
